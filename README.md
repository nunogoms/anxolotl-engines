# Anxolotl-engines

## Introduction

This repository contains two machine learning algorithms focused on mental health metrics
preloaded and with all the parameters already chosen. The current available parts are:

- [Anxiety Engine](anxiety_engine): The machine learning algorithm to classify anxiety state,
  distinguishing between 3 levels.
- [Panic Engine](panic_engine): The machine learning algorithm to distinguish between panic states (Non-Panic and panic)
- [Datasets](datasets): Contains small versions of the datasets, as well as information on how to
  download the full version.

### Origin

This work is part of the Anxolotl System and thesis by the name of
Anxolotl - An Anxiety Companion App. It was developed at Instituto Superior de Engenharia
de Lisboa, Instituto Polit√©cnico de Lisboa in Portugal. 

The work here available makes part of a full distributed system intended to detect mental
health metrics. These algorithms pertain to the detection sector of the work, and are here
available for further development. 

## Setup

This document describes how to setup all the dependencies to run the notebooks in this
repository in following platforms:

- Linux
- Mac OS
- Windows (Using WSL)

### Pre Requisites

All the necessary steps to run each engine are included in each folder. 

- [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
- [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
- [OPTIONAL] An IDE running python (I use [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/))
- Terminal can also be used
