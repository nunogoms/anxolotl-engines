## Datasets

This is the directory were both programs expect the datasets to be.

The two used datasets for this effort were MMASH and Anxiety Phases Dataset

[Anxiety Phases Dataset](https://bridges.monash.edu/articles/dataset/Anxiety_Phases_Dataset/15176082#:~:text=The%20dataset%20in%20this%20repository,phobic%20and%20social%20anxiety%20experience.)

[MMASH Dataset](https://physionet.org/content/mmash/1.0.0/)

### Proceeding

For the **MMASH dataset** , all that is needed is to download the dataset and extract it here

For the **Anxiety Phases dataset**, you will need to download it, and extract it here as well, but for minimal memory usage
the minimal ammount of data is :
- participant_details.csv
- electrocardiogram_data

In the electrocardiogram_data folder, please join all the data containing files in two already created folders :
- bug_box_task
- speaking_task

**With all of this performed the code should be able to run**
